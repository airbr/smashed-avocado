*A personal project to practice some core web skills and have some fun*

Smashed Advocado is a web app able to handle a particular kind of form submission for orders for smashed advocado and store them to a remote Firebase Database using Ajax. I intend to develop it further into a more Progressive Web App. 

The initial commit of this project was drawn significantly from the Big Nerd Ranch Guide to Front End Web Development on the topic of Ajax. I have improved it by adding a simple demonstration of hosting my own remote service with Firebase Realtime database and adjusting the Ajax calls. 

Technologies used include: 

  * HTML, 
  * CSS (Bootstrap), 
  * JavaScript, 
  * JQuery, 
  * Firebase Realtime Database
